# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing biometric face comparison system by integrating liveness detection as a prerequisite step and improving the face comparison algorithm to prevent false matches between different individuals. The enhancement addresses two critical security vulnerabilities: the lack of liveness verification before face comparison and the current algorithm's tendency to incorrectly match different people as the same person.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security-conscious application developer, I want liveness detection to be performed before face comparison, so that I can ensure both images contain live faces before determining if they match.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a face comparison request is made THEN the system SHALL perform liveness detection on both images before proceeding with comparison
2. WHEN either image fails liveness detection THEN the system SHALL return an error indicating which image(s) failed liveness check
3. WHEN both images pass liveness detection THEN the system SHALL proceed with face comparison
4. WHEN liveness detection is performed THEN the system SHALL use goroutines to check both images simultaneously for optimal performance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a biometric system user, I want the face comparison algorithm to accurately distinguish between different people, so that I can trust the system won't incorrectly match faces of different individuals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing faces of two different people THEN the system SHALL return a match result of false
2. WHEN the similarity score is calculated THEN the system SHALL use improved feature extraction methods that better distinguish between different individuals
3. WHEN face comparison is performed THEN the system SHALL apply stricter thresholds and validation to prevent false positives
4. WHEN faces are processed THEN the system SHALL normalize and preprocess images consistently to improve comparison accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want the enhanced face comparison endpoint to provide detailed feedback about liveness detection results, so that I can understand why a comparison succeeded or failed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a face comparison request is processed THEN the response SHALL include liveness detection results for both images
2. WHEN liveness detection fails THEN the response SHALL include specific reasons for the failure
3. WHEN face comparison is successful THEN the response SHALL include both liveness scores and similarity scores
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the response SHALL include timing information for both liveness detection and face comparison phases

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the enhanced biometric system to maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints, so that current integrations continue to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing liveness detection endpoints are called THEN they SHALL continue to function as before
2. WHEN existing face comparison endpoints are called THEN they SHALL use the enhanced algorithm while maintaining the same response structure
3. WHEN new enhanced endpoints are added THEN they SHALL be clearly distinguished from existing endpoints
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN existing API contracts SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want the enhanced face comparison to complete within reasonable time limits, so that my application remains responsive to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN liveness detection is performed on both images THEN the total processing time SHALL not exceed 10 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN face comparison is performed THEN the enhanced algorithm SHALL complete within 5 seconds after liveness detection
3. WHEN goroutines are used for parallel processing THEN the system SHALL properly handle concurrent operations without race conditions
4. WHEN processing fails due to timeout THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages indicating the timeout reason
