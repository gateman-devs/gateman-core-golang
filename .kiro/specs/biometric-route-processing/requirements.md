# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements the actual processing logic in the production liveness routes. Currently, the routes are defined but the processing functions are not being called properly in the route handlers. The system needs to connect the HTTP endpoints to the underlying biometric processing capabilities provided by the facematch infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the biometric API, I want the liveness detection endpoint to actually process images and return real results, so that I can implement anti-spoofing functionality in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/production/liveness/detect` THEN the system SHALL call the actual liveness detection processing function
2. WHEN the processing function is called THEN the system SHALL use the facematch.GlobalFaceMatcher to perform anti-spoofing detection
3. WHEN liveness detection completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a properly formatted ProductionLivenessResponse
4. WHEN liveness detection fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses with detailed error information
5. WHEN verbose mode is requested THEN the system SHALL include detailed analysis breakdown in the response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the biometric API, I want the face comparison endpoint to actually compare faces and return similarity scores, so that I can implement face matching functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/production/liveness/compare` THEN the system SHALL call the actual face comparison processing function
2. WHEN the processing function is called THEN the system SHALL use the facematch.GlobalFaceMatcher.Compare method
3. WHEN face comparison completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a properly formatted ProductionFaceComparisonResponse with similarity scores
4. WHEN face comparison fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN threshold is not provided THEN the system SHALL use the default threshold of 0.7

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the biometric API, I want the image quality assessment endpoint to actually analyze image quality, so that I can validate images before processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/production/liveness/quality` THEN the system SHALL call the actual image quality processing function
2. WHEN the processing function is called THEN the system SHALL use the facematch.GlobalFaceMatcher.VerifyImageQuality method
3. WHEN quality assessment completes successfully THEN the system SHALL return a properly formatted ProductionImageQualityResponse
4. WHEN quality assessment fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error responses
5. WHEN image has quality issues THEN the system SHALL include specific issues and recommendations in the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the biometric API, I want the batch liveness detection endpoint to process multiple images efficiently, so that I can perform bulk liveness checks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is made to `/production/liveness/batch/detect` THEN the system SHALL call the actual batch processing function
2. WHEN the processing function is called THEN the system SHALL process each image in the batch using liveness detection
3. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL return a properly formatted ProductionBatchLivenessResponse with results for all images
4. WHEN some images fail processing THEN the system SHALL include error information for failed images while still processing successful ones
5. WHEN verbose mode is requested THEN the system SHALL include detailed analysis for each image in the batch

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging in all processing functions, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the biometric system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any processing function encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate context
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with clear error codes
3. WHEN the facematch service is not initialized THEN the system SHALL return appropriate service unavailable errors
4. WHEN processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL include processing time metrics in responses
5. WHEN requests include request IDs THEN the system SHALL use them for tracking, otherwise generate unique IDs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the biometric API, I want consistent response formats across all endpoints, so that I can handle responses predictably in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any endpoint returns a successful response THEN the system SHALL use the standardized response format with message and body structure
2. WHEN any endpoint returns an error response THEN the system SHALL use consistent error response format with error codes and timestamps
3. WHEN processing time is measured THEN the system SHALL include it in the response in milliseconds
4. WHEN request IDs are used THEN the system SHALL include them in all responses for tracking
5. WHEN timestamps are included THEN the system SHALL use consistent ISO 8601 format
