# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive documentation for the biometric testing system that includes liveness detection, face comparison, image quality assessment, and anti-spoofing capabilities. The system currently has production-ready endpoints and advanced analysis features but lacks proper documentation for developers, testers, and end users. The documentation should cover API endpoints, testing procedures, configuration options, and troubleshooting guides.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the biometric API, I want comprehensive API documentation so that I can understand how to use all available endpoints effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer accesses the API documentation THEN the system SHALL provide complete endpoint specifications including request/response formats, parameters, and examples
2. WHEN a developer reviews endpoint documentation THEN the system SHALL include authentication requirements, rate limiting information, and error handling details
3. WHEN a developer needs to understand data formats THEN the system SHALL provide detailed schema definitions for all request and response structures
4. WHEN a developer wants to test endpoints THEN the system SHALL include working code examples in multiple programming languages
5. WHEN a developer encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive error code documentation with troubleshooting steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want detailed testing documentation so that I can create comprehensive test cases for the biometric functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a QA engineer needs to test liveness detection THEN the system SHALL provide test scenarios covering various image types, lighting conditions, and spoof attempts
2. WHEN a QA engineer tests face comparison THEN the system SHALL include test cases for different similarity thresholds, image qualities, and edge cases
3. WHEN a QA engineer validates image quality assessment THEN the system SHALL provide test data sets with known quality metrics and expected outcomes
4. WHEN a QA engineer performs anti-spoofing tests THEN the system SHALL include test scenarios for different spoofing methods and detection capabilities
5. WHEN a QA engineer needs to verify batch processing THEN the system SHALL provide test cases for batch operations with various image combinations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration and deployment documentation so that I can properly set up and maintain the biometric service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator deploys the service THEN the system SHALL provide complete setup instructions including model file requirements and environment configuration
2. WHEN an administrator configures the service THEN the system SHALL document all configuration parameters, their effects, and recommended values
3. WHEN an administrator monitors the service THEN the system SHALL provide documentation for health endpoints, metrics, and logging configuration
4. WHEN an administrator troubleshoots issues THEN the system SHALL include common problems, diagnostic steps, and resolution procedures
5. WHEN an administrator needs to scale the service THEN the system SHALL provide performance tuning guidelines and resource requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a business user, I want user-friendly documentation explaining biometric capabilities so that I can understand what the system can and cannot do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a business user reviews capabilities THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanations of liveness detection, face comparison, and quality assessment features
2. WHEN a business user needs to understand limitations THEN the system SHALL document supported image formats, size limits, and processing constraints
3. WHEN a business user evaluates accuracy THEN the system SHALL provide information about confidence scores, thresholds, and expected performance metrics
4. WHEN a business user plans integration THEN the system SHALL include use case examples and best practices for different scenarios
5. WHEN a business user needs compliance information THEN the system SHALL document security features, data handling, and privacy considerations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the analysis reporting system, I want detailed documentation on the advanced analysis features so that I can interpret and utilize the comprehensive analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer uses verbose analysis mode THEN the system SHALL provide documentation explaining all analysis breakdown components and their meanings
2. WHEN a developer interprets analysis results THEN the system SHALL document the scoring systems, thresholds, and decision logic used in anti-spoofing detection
3. WHEN a developer needs performance metrics THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on timing measurements, resource usage, and optimization recommendations
4. WHEN a developer works with quality metrics THEN the system SHALL document all quality assessment parameters, their ranges, and interpretation guidelines
5. WHEN a developer implements custom analysis THEN the system SHALL provide extension points documentation and customization examples
